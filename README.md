### Two-Dice Pig

This variation is the same as Pig, except:

* Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the
  turn total.
* If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
* If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
* If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game)
